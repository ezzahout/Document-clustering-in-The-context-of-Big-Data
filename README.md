# Document-clustering-in-The-context-of-Big-Data

Document clustering involves the use of descriptors and descriptor extraction. Descriptors are sets of words that describe the contents within the cluster. Document clustering is generally considered to be a centralized process. Examples of document clustering include web document clustering for search users.

The application of document clustering can be categorized to two types, online and offline. Online applications are usually constrained by efficiency problems when compared to offline applications. Text clustering may be used for different tasks, such as grouping similar documents (news, tweets, etc.) and the analysis of customer/employee feedback, discovering meaningful implicit subjects across all documents.

Text and docs clustering is a process that involves Natural Language Processing (NLP) and the use of a clustering algorithm. This method of finding groups in unstructured texts can be applied in many different segments, such as feedback analysis, research segmentation, etc.
